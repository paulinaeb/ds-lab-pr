We take action in response to emergencies and, at the same time, promote respect for international humanitarian law. We are an independent and neutral organization, and our mandate stems essentially from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. We work closely with National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and with their International Federation in order to ensure a concerted, rational and rapid humanitarian response to the needs of the victims of armed conflict or any other situation of internal violence. We direct and coordinate the international activities conducted in these situations.\n\nDigital transformation is profoundly impacting armed conflict and humanitarian action.

With its R&D identity and expertise, the Delegation connects to internal initiatives and efforts to adapt to an increasingly digital world, to anchor that work squarely in and at the service of field operations and affected people, and to support a principled digital transformation. This includes proximity, do-no-harm and confidentiality in its use of digital technology, and strengthening ICRC capacity to integrate the cyber/digital dimension in its operations and its response to people’s needs.

    "Title": "Strong Middle SecOps Analyst / Incident Responder",
    "Description": "In-depth Investigation: Analyze escalated alerts and incidents from L1. Use advanced forensic and analysis tools to perform deep-dive investigations where appropriate. More often than not, this will simply be consulting additional threat intel sources and closer examination of logs, as deep forensic analysis is typically only required for certain incidents where compromise has occurred.On rare occasions, the investigation might conclude that the alert was triggered due to the legacy alert triggers (SIEM saved search with triggers) design flaws resulting in false positives. While investigating the alert L2 should examine if the alert triggers could be improved based on the investigation outcome and consult that with L3.What you will do Basic Threat Containment: Take limited containment actions under strict guidelines, such as isolating suspicious hosts (when permitted). These guidelines need to be established for internal Platform level accounts, as well as for customer (digital product) accounts. Threat Intelligence Correlation: Leverage threat intelligence sources to correlate indicators and identify broader threat campaigns or tactics used by attackers. There are often security communities / forums where trusted industry professionals post information about active attacks they are seeing. Crowd-sourced threat intel can also be useful. Containment & Mitigation: Coordinate with product teams to implement containment measures (e.g., blocking IPs, disabling accounts, quarantining devices) and lead initial remediation efforts. During these occurrences consult with product teams about their appetite for participating in automatic remediation / mitigations. Report that to L3. In order to perform remediation (either manually or through automation) on behalf of a product, agreements must be in place that indicate which containment measures are authorized to be performed.Incident Handling: Act as the primary handler for incidents, leading analysis, investigation, and coordination efforts until resolution.Root Cause Analysis: Conduct detailed root cause analysis on incidents and assist with recommendations for future prevention.Playbook & SOP Enhancement: Review and update incident response playbooks and procedures to reflect new threats and improve efficiency. Based on feedback from L1 or if identified that an area does not have a runbook created – develop such a runbook if possible. Consult L3 in case L2 is unable to deliver the runbook themself.Escalation to L3: Escalate complex or high-impact incidents to L3 with a detailed analysis and recommendations.What you need for this4+ years of experience as SecOps Engineer.Intermediate knowledge of network and Cloud security, including malware analysis and packet analysis. Forensic experience is also a plus.Hands-on experience with Splunk and AWS environments.Experience with threat intelligence and incident response tools.Strong problem-solving skills and ability to handle more complex or persistent threats.Security Certification(s) and/or strong educational background in security, as well as experience working in a SOC.Basic knowledge of Python or any other scripting language.What it’s like to work at IntelliasAt Intellias, where technology takes center stage, people always come before processes.

And finally, you’re open and borderless – naturally inclusive in how you work with others.\n\nRequired Skills and Experience:\n\n Programming experience. Since security analysts are charged with defending digital infrastructure, it makes sense that security professionals are expected to have some base level of programming experience and familiarity with foundational programming languages such as C, C++, PHP, Perl, and Java.  Analytical. Security analysts work with data from a variety of sources and so they need to be able to take information from many inputs to make decisions.  Detail-oriented. Much of the work of security analysts comes down to examining small details — like lines of computer code or network commands — that could have major impacts.  Forward-thinking. Security analysts need to anticipate the future based on current data and trends and then make security recommendations accordingly. 2+ years of experience in a Cybersecurity fieldExpertise in network routing and switching, network troubleshooting, engineering and infrastructure, load balancing, and virtual private networksProficiency in cloud computing and security architecture, hybrid and multi-cloud computing, and various cloud-based systems and servicesFamiliar with vulnerability scanning, application security, penetration testing, encryption, threat modeling, identity and access management, and secure codingGood knowledge of cyber security, incident response, security operations, vulnerability management, IT security architecture, risk management, cyber threat hunting, and cyber security standards\n\nPreferred Skills And Experience\n\nValid and current certification or equivalent experience in one of the following: CISSP / CompTIA Security+ / Certified Cloud Security Professional / GIAC Security EssentialsSecurity Operations Center experienceSecurity tooling for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)Anti-virus Vulnerability Management Scanning and RemediationTechnical architecture skillsExperience Advising C suiteFamiliarity with DevSecOps practices and methodologies, and experience integrating security into agile development processesFamiliarity with emerging security technologies and trends, such as artificial intelligence/machine learning in security, zero trust architecture, or secure remote access solutions\n\nBeing You\n\nDiversity is a whole lot more than what we look like or where we come from, it’s how we think and who we are.

We are now established in the DACH region with an office in Munich/Germany.\n\nOur mission to protect organizations from cyber threats guides us and drives us every day. But that’s not enough for us. If Cybersecurity keeps the world go round, then our performance must help to change it for the better.\n\nTogether and ahead of the game: since our very beginnings, we have been driven by three strong values. More than just a trademark, they're our driving force to act today and do better tomorrow: #Boldness #Collective #Impact \n\n🚀 What’s in for you ?\n\nA welcoming team, training, transition, mobility – we support each project according to the desires and ambitions of each individual. We believe in work-life balance as a vehicle for personal fulfillment, so we have opted for autonomy and freedom in the workplace but also in the way we organize ourselves daily. And to nurture our precious collective spirit, our weeks are characterized by various moments of sociability and sharing... always with a backdrop of humor (more or less accessible 😅). Every day we take action on social impact projects through our fund “Advens for People and Planet” whether they’re centered on education, inclusion, or preserving the climate and environment. You have a social project you want to support? Use our internal team fundraising and collect money from colleagues and the company monthly. \n\nAs you can see, we're looking for more than just Cybersecurity experts - we're looking for committed and passionate people.\n\nJob Description\n\nAs part of our Blue Team, at the heart of our SOC, you will participate in identifying abnormal behavior or vulnerabilities to protect our customers’ information systems.\n\n🤓 Your mission\n\nAssist your customer base in protecting their information systems by identifying abnormal behavior. Develop and submit a remediation plan adapted to your customers’ situation and business risks. Report any incidents detected to your customers. Be involved in the improvement of our SOC’s security incident detection techniques and rules, and therefore contribute to the development of a unique product on the Cybersecurity market. \n\n🤠 Your potential projects\n\nWhat other concrete activities could you take part in if you joined us? The SOC algorithms detect weak signals: it is up to you to analyze them.\n\nWork with SOC L3 experts to counter the most sophisticated attacks. Inform the product team of changes to be made to the analysis and incident reporting tools. Guide and advise your customers’ operational security team when they deal with a security incident. When a customer’s CISO must react to an incident, advise them on which operations they should carry out. \n\nQualifications\n\n🤩 So, is this the right job for you?\n\nYou are tech-savvy: being able to recognize attacks is vital to stop them. You are comfortable working with many SOC customers at the same time. In the starting blocks: you keep an eye out for attacks and like to react quickly. You enjoy advising customers: after your analysis, you can present your action plans to them and provide full support along the way. You see the benefit of processes in helping you to monitor and improve what is already in place. Innovation is important to you. You can use what you see daily to improve defense systems, particularly through the definition of detection rules. You want to evolve in your career! As a Security Analyst, you are also prepared to become a consultant on specific technologies, or even to progress to other jobs. You are passionate about security and are looking for projects with added value within a dynamic company. \n\nLanguage skills (mandatory):\n\nGerman (full professional proficiency) andEnglish (full professional proficiency)\n\nLocation:\n\nMunich (Germany) orRemote (from anywhere in Germany)\n\nAdditional Information\n\n💪 Your team \n\nIn Germany we are currently a small but fast-growing team of fifteen people.

    "Title": "Senior SecOps Analyst / Incident Responder",
    "Description": "In-depth Investigation: Analyze escalated alerts and incidents from L1. Use advanced forensic and analysis tools to perform deep-dive investigations where appropriate. More often than not, this will simply be consulting additional threat intel sources and closer examination of logs, as deep forensic analysis is typically only required for certain incidents where compromise has occurred.On rare occasions, the investigation might conclude that the alert was triggered due to the legacy alert triggers (SIEM saved search with triggers) design flaws resulting in false positives. While investigating the alert L2 should examine if the alert triggers could be improved based on the investigation outcome and consult that with L3.What you will do Basic Threat Containment: Take limited containment actions under strict guidelines, such as isolating suspicious hosts (when permitted). These guidelines need to be established for internal Platform level accounts, as well as for customer (digital product) accounts. Threat Intelligence Correlation: Leverage threat intelligence sources to correlate indicators and identify broader threat campaigns or tactics used by attackers. There are often security communities / forums where trusted industry professionals post information about active attacks they are seeing. Crowd-sourced threat intel can also be useful. Containment & Mitigation: Coordinate with product teams to implement containment measures (e.g., blocking IPs, disabling accounts, quarantining devices) and lead initial remediation efforts. During these occurrences consult with product teams about their appetite for participating in automatic remediation / mitigations. Report that to L3. In order to perform remediation (either manually or through automation) on behalf of a product, agreements must be in place that indicate which containment measures are authorized to be performed.Incident Handling: Act as the primary handler for incidents, leading analysis, investigation, and coordination efforts until resolution.Root Cause Analysis: Conduct detailed root cause analysis on incidents and assist with recommendations for future prevention.Playbook & SOP Enhancement: Review and update incident response playbooks and procedures to reflect new threats and improve efficiency. Based on feedback from L1 or if identified that an area does not have a runbook created – develop such a runbook if possible. Consult L3 in case L2 is unable to deliver the runbook themself.Escalation to L3: Escalate complex or high-impact incidents to L3 with a detailed analysis and recommendations.What you need for this 5+ years of experience as SecOps engineer.Good knowledge of network and Cloud security, including malware analysis and packet analysis. Forensic experience is also a plus.Hands-on experience with Splunk and AWS environments.Experience with threat intelligence and incident response tools.Strong problem-solving skills and ability to handle more complex or persistent threats.Security Certification(s) and/or strong educational background in security, as well as experience working in a SOC.Basic knowledge of Python or any other scripting language.What it’s like to work at IntelliasAt Intellias, where technology takes center stage, people always come before processes.

    "Description": "Job Description\n\nAbout Northwave\n\nFrom our head office in Utrecht (Netherlands), we have been providing 24*7 cybersecurity services for more than 18 years. In doing so, we not only look at the technology, but also at the human behaviour within the organisation and thus provide integrated security services. That's why organisations that take their cyber security seriously like to work with us. We take the complexity of security management off their hands, leaving them in control.\n\nWe are a fast-growing organization of 275+ employees, which is the market leader in the field of information security. Our 100% self-financed European company is on a mission to make high-quality, integrated information security accessible to organizations that depend on their digital business. Northwave stands for diversity, inclusivity, quality and long-term relationships.\n\nYour Mission\n\nAs a SOC Analyst, you’ll be responsible for handling the operational tasks of our Security Operations Center (SOC). This involves managing incoming alarms, service requests, and customer calls. You’ll analyze alarms originating from our clients’ networks to provide comprehensive reports, determine whether clients should be informed, and guide them with appropriate next steps based on established procedures and playbooks. Additionally, you’ll coordinate with team members to mitigate threats that fall outside existing playbooks, address questions from clients via email or phone, conduct vulnerability scans, and prepare monthly reports. You’ll also support other analysts as needed, based on your expertise and experience.\n\nAs a virtual extension from our German headquarters in Leipzig, you’ll join our dynamic Operations team within the SOC, comprised of enthusiastic security analysts from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. With the expertise of our SOC and Northwave, you’ll collaborate with professionals from various IT security disciplines, fostering continuous development. You’ll be part of a challenging work environment with a collaborative team culture where fun and teamwork are valued. Your role will involve investigating and analyzing security incidents, continuously improving work processes, informing clients about their security risks, and learning about the SOC and cybersecurity.\n\nWhat can you expect from us?\n\nContract\n\nFirst things first: you will receive a permanent employment contract with 30 days' holiday per year. You can organise your own working hours in consultation with your colleagues and customers.\n\nDevelopment\n\nWhat do you want to achieve and what support do you need? You will receive regular training and support in achieving your professional goals. You can also develop further within Northwave.\n\nTeam\n\nIt is important to us to respect and value each other - as professionals and as people. The best way to get to know your 275+ colleagues from the Netherlands and Germany is to take part in one of our many activities, such as our annual trip to the theme park.\n\nEquipment\n\nYou will be equipped with a modern MacBook and iPhone. We have height-adjustable desks in our offices and our CEO loves to set us up with merchandise ;-)\n\nMobility\n\nFor your way to work you will get a Deutschlandticket or Lease Bike. You decide.\n\nWhat else...\n\nNo, the fruit basket in the office is not a benefit for us, but a matter of course - just like coffee, tea and lemonade. Have you ever tried Dutch caramel waffles?\n\nJob Requirements\n\nThe most important thing for us is that you fit into the team and are keen to help shape and advance Northwave. Of course, we also have a few technical requirements for this position.\n\nEducation and experience\n\nYou have a relevant academic degree and ideally a SC-200, Security+ or similar certificates. You already have some experience within the cybersecurity field. You speak both very good German and English.\n\nOther strengths\n\nYou can work independently, are well structured and communicative. You have the availability for on-call shifts outside regular office hours. And most importantly, you are looking forward to working with a great group of security enthusiasts.\n\nInterested?\n\nI look forward to receiving your application.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me directly:\n\nkatja.hempel@northwave-security.com\n\n+49 173 687 2818",

This involves managing incoming alarms, service requests, and customer calls. You’ll analyze alarms originating from our clients’ networks to provide comprehensive reports, determine whether clients should be informed, and guide them with appropriate next steps based on established procedures and playbooks.

You’ll also support other analysts as needed, based on your expertise and experience.\n\nAs a virtual extension from our German headquarters in Leipzig, you’ll join our dynamic Operations team within the SOC, comprised of enthusiastic security analysts from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. With the expertise of our SOC and Northwave, you’ll collaborate with professionals from various IT security disciplines, fostering continuous development. You’ll be part of a challenging work environment with a collaborative team culture where fun and teamwork are valued. Your role will involve investigating and analyzing security incidents, continuously improving work processes, informing clients about their security risks, and learning about the SOC and cybersecurity.\n\nWhat can you expect from us?\n\nContract\n\nFirst things first: you will receive a permanent employment contract with 30 days' holiday per year.

We have height-adjustable desks in our offices and our CEO loves to set us up with merchandise ;-)\n\nMobility\n\nFor your way to work you will get a Deutschlandticket or Lease Bike. You decide.\n\nWhat else...\n\nNo, the fruit basket in the office is not a benefit for us, but a matter of course - just like coffee, tea and lemonade. Have you ever tried Dutch caramel waffles?\n\nJob Requirements\n\nThe most important thing for us is that you fit into the team and are keen to help shape and advance Northwave. Of course, we also have a few technical requirements for this position.\n\nEducation and experience\n\nYou have a relevant academic degree and ideally a SC-200, Security+ or similar certificates.

Notre mission est de protéger les gouvernements, le milieu militaire et les entreprises d'infrastructures nationales essentielles, contre les cybermenaces.\n\nNous comptons plus de 1 600 experts répartis sur nos principaux sites en France, en Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni, chacun disposant d'un centre opérationnel de sécurité. Nous sommes également présents aux États-Unis et au Moyen-Orient.\n\nNous proposons une approche globale de la cyberdéfense qui vise à protéger, détecter et répondre aux cybermenaces grâce à un portefeuille comprenant des services de sécurité gérés, des offres de systèmes de contrôle industriel, des services de cryptage, de gestion des clés et de conseil.\n\nNotre objectif : protéger nos clients et répondre à leurs besoins grâce à des produits de cybersécurité.\n\nNous sommes passionnés par la cybersécurité.

La surveillance continue se concentre sur les menaces potentielles détectées par les capteurs déployés sur les différents périmètres.

Nous intervenons en cas d'incident lorsque nous sommes chargés de le faire ou lorsque nous ne parvenons pas à contenir un adversaire par les moyens habituels. Ces trois modes sont interdépendants. Nous utilisons la chasse aux menaces de manière combinée (en mélangeant le SOC, la gestion des menaces et la RI) afin de permettre le développement des compétences et une transition plus aisée d'un mode à l'autre.

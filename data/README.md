# Data

This project uses an external dataset due to its size.

ðŸ“‚ You can download the data from the following link:
([Download dataset](https://eltehu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/paulinaeb_student_elte_hu/Emp7X-9_FthEnhhDsHGXbtwBXBeu7jHp6usXMBCqkly05g?e=FuEXze))

Once downloaded, place it in this folder (`/data`) with the same structure. You can directly use the already translated and sort of preprocessed file "data.json" running the main notebook, or you can also run the whole process: merge-data, translate and then main (this may take hours).

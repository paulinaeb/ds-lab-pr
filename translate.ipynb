    "Europe is home to 24 official different languages. Although there are not many countries recognizing English as an official language, it is widely known that you can communicate in that language on most of the continent. Moreover, knowledge of English has become a necessity for those working in the IT industry and it represents the predominant language of communication in the technical domain as it facilitates global collaboration. \n",

    "Currently, our dataset combines multiple european languages across the samples obtained. Having English as the language of the dataset is ideal, and in this notebook we are going to, basically, detect the languages per row and, if the ad is not in english, we'll translate it to this language to ensure data consistency. \n",
